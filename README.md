# NBA Classifier
A simple machine learning model designed to predict what position an NBA player is most likely to play. The following [API](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) was used to pull training and testing data from [nba.com](https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nba?gr=www). 

The model is built with R and uses paradigms from the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) package. The model was made for an end-of-term project in DSCI 100 (Introduction to Data Science) at the University of British Columbia, in the 2023 winter session.
